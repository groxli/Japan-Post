SCRIPTS FOR LOADING/EXTRACTING DATA
====================================
In order to recreate the analysis model, you'll want to make sure you have the KEN_ALL.csv file from the Japan Post.  Available at: http://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/download.html

The scripts are located in the scripts/ directory.  Make sure the #! declaration points to your php binary.  Also don't forget to check database settings.

Run the load scripts in this order:
1) load_todofuken.php
2) load_joyo_kanji.php
3) load_addresses.php

Extract data with these scripts:
get_colors.php - generates extracts/color_count.csv.
get_kanji.php - generates extracts/unique_glyphs.csv.
get_postkanji_by_grades.php - currently not used.
get_tokyo_kanji.php - generates extracts/tokyo_kanji.csv
get_tokyo_unique_kanji.php - generates/extracts/tokyo_unique_kanji.csv

process.log - the log of the scripts' activities.
